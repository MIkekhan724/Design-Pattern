It state that "Interface Should be such that, the client should not implements the unnecessory functions they do not need.

public interface ResturantEmployee{
  void washDishes();
  void serveCustomer();
  void cookFood();
}

public class Waiter implements ResturantEmployee{

  public void washDishes()
  {
    // not my job
  }

  public void serveCustomer(){
    Systemo.out.println(" Serve the customer");
  }

  public void cookFood(){
    // Not my Job
  }
}


# here waiter have to implements all the method that is unnecessory to waoid this we have to segrigate interface
